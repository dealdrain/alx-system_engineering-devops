Postmortem
When the project System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19 was availed, an outage happened when I had no idea how to commence.
In Summary
A wrong file name caused the issue in code and needed a rectification. The correct file name, located in the wp-content directory of the application folder, was class-wp-locale.php.
The issue
Optimize cache eviction policies: Assess and refine cache eviction policies by analyzing usage patterns and expected fluctuations in traffic.
Scale cache infrastructure: Evaluate the existing cache infrastructure and determine whether additional resources or distributed caching solutions are necessary to manage peak loads effectively.
Enhance monitoring and alerts: Deploy comprehensive monitoring across the entire web stack, monitoring cache usage, response times, and database performance to quickly detect any abnormalities.
Load testing and capacity planning: Conduct regular load testing to simulate various traffic scenarios and verify that the system can handle increased loads without compromising performance.
Improve incident response process: Streamline the escalation process and clearly define roles and responsibilities for incident response to ensure smooth collaboration among teams during critical situations.
Resolution
Revise cache eviction policies: Modify the cache eviction strategies to favor frequently accessed data, accounting for memory limitations.
Assess cache infrastructure: Evaluate the current cache infrastructure's capabilities and investigate options for scaling or integrating distributed caching solutions.
Deploy thorough monitoring: Implement a monitoring system encompassing cache utilization, response times, and database performance, accompanied by relevant alert mechanisms.
Execute load testing: Create and run load testing scenarios to verify the system's performance across different traffic scenarios.
Refine incident response protocols: Review and enhance the incident response procedures to facilitate prompt detection, investigation, and resolution of forthcoming incidents.
Prevention
This outage was an application error. The underlisted are preventive measures to avert such situations in future:
i.	Proper testing of application
ii.	Independent review of codes
iii.	Proper documentation of code
